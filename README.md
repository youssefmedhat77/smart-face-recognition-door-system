i used my laptop web cam to recognize a certian face and this only face that can actuate the servo motor i used, it connected to PIN9 in arduino uno
when you press "s" you save the reference face and the servo rotate 90 degree
when pres "c" the servo return to it's initial position
if you move away from the camera for short time then return back the servo will rotate 90 degree
if any face axcept the reference one try to actuate the servo it will not.
